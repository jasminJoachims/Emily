    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Just because you're great and you should know it</h1>
    <br>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Reasons why Em is great:</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">She always gives 100% for any customer, no matter if the read sucks or not (and it often does)</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">She's a smartass (and yes, I'm often the recipient and yes, it is upsetting to be outsmarted but I love it)</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">She's the kindest person that I know and there is no greater compliment to give</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">She's very pretty (and it's important to emphasize this again, so she'll start believing it)</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">She's a great cook (though the jury is still out on whether she's better than me, #humbleandgay)</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">She's genuinely funny and so very few people are (or have the same weird humour [seeeee that I wrote humour!!])
    <p style="text-align: center;">She is a great hugger, a great cuddler and an even better kisser...and damn all three of those (also, thank God)</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">She always takes care of everyone else and never expects anyone to take care of her (but I want to and I will)</p>

    <<h3 style="text-align: center;">Possible improvements (you did scroll down, don't blame me):</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Should really stop claiming to be taller (half an inch, whoever believes that?)</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Should stop saying I sound like a pigeon when I roll my Rrrrs (because, really, I don't, she's just hearing impaired)</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Has obviously no idea how much milk one can safely put into tea (obviously)</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Drives around curves like a maniac but denies it every time (really, who are we kidding here?)</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">And many more things I will hopefully discover soon, so I can tease her about them</p>
